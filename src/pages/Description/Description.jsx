                    The story takes place in Taish≈ç era Japan, where a secret
                    society, known as the Demon Slayer Corps, has been waging a
                    secret war against demons for centuries. The demons are
                    former humans who were turned into demons by Muzan Kibutsuji
                    injecting them with his own blood, and they feed on humans
                    and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength,
                    powers that demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art", and
                    regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they are
                    decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as
                    Nichirin, injected with poison extracted from wisteria
                    flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the
                    other hand, are entirely human; however, they employ special
                    elemental breathing techniques, known as "Breathing Styles",
                    which grant them superhuman strength and increased
                    resistance, helping them fight against demons. The strongest
                    Demon Slayers are known as the Hashira, and gain this rank
                    through either killing a member of the Twelve Kizuki (the
                    twelve strongest demons under Muzan) or killing fifty demons
                    after ranking up multiple times.
